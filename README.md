# Matlab-Pendulum-Simulations
Double and single pendulum simulations using the runge kutta method.

To run the single pendulum simulation, the pendulum.m and rkCalculator.m files need to be in the same directory.

To run the double pendulu, simulatio,, the doublePendulum.m and rk2Calculator.m files need to be in the same directory.

To kill the simulation after it starts running, go to the matlab console and press 'ctrl-c' as there doesn't appear to be a way to have matlab kill it when the 'x' is pressed.
